# Auto Audiobooks
Convert pdf to audiobooks üìö


**Inspiration** : 
I am a nerd ü§ì. I like reading research papers, articles and books. I also travel alot often from my work city to my hometown. During which I tend to feel unwell on account of motion sickness, if I read while travelling. Have been looking for a tool but either some of them had paid implementation or restrictions. Also audiobooks are pretty cool to multitask on and keep them running in the background üññüèª

So inspiration was to use existing tech available and with ~20 lines of code, build a simple, pdf -> audiobook generator. ü§ûüèª

## Implementation

Source code - [Auto Audio Book](https://github.com/bhavita/Auto-Audio-Books/blob/master/Auto_AudioBooks.ipynb)

## Google Cloud Text-To-Speech Implementation for Higher Quality Audio Transcription

For the given code to run smoothly, users will have a few prerequisites and setup steps they need to follow before running the Google Cloud example script (`gcloud_api_AudioBooks.py`).

---

### Prerequisites and Setup for Text-to-Speech Synthesis:

#### 1. **Environment:**

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. The code seems to be Python 3.x compatible, so a recent version of Python 3 would be best.

- **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**: It's recommended to run this in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages.

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
  ```

#### 2. **Google Cloud SDK and Project Setup**:

- **Google Cloud SDK**: Ensure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and initialized.

- **Google Cloud Project**: Create a project on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

- **Enable Text-to-Speech API**: Navigate to the [Text-to-Speech API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/texttospeech.googleapis.com) and ensure the API is enabled for your project.

#### 3. **Authentication**:

- **Service Account**: Create a service account with roles that grant permissions to use the Text-to-Speech API. Download the JSON key for this service account.

- **Environment Variable**: Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the service account key:

  ```bash
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"
  ```

  This ensures the client library knows where to find your credentials.

#### 4. **Dependencies**:

- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Library**: Install the required library using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-cloud-texttospeech
  ```

---

### Running the Code:

1. Activate your virtual environment if you set one up.
2. Run the provided script:

   ```bash
   python gcloud_api_AudioBooks.py
   ```

3. If successful, you'll find generated MP3 files with names like `output_0.mp3`, `output_1.mp3`, etc. in the current directory.

---

### Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter any `InvalidArgument` errors, the input might be too long or the voice might not be available. Consider shortening the text or choosing a different voice.

- Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions for the Text-to-Speech API.

- Check quota limits on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you're making a large number of requests.
